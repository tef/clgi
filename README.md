# CLGI: A commandline toolkit for python

What if you could write a CLI that's more like a webapp?

- Defining app subcommands through routes
- Getting tab completion for free
- Built in pager for long output
- ... and more!

Check out the examples directory, but please note this is absolutely
a work in progress, and some of the apis and internals may change.

Especially because I plan to move to asyncio
